# Reading-Habits-vs-Income-Analysis

### Description
Being that many of the world's wealthiest people read frequently, this analysis attempts to uncover a potential relationship between reading habits and annual income, as well as find other possible factors that may link them together.

The dataset used in this analysis is from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipulgote4/reading-habit-dataset?datasetId=856212&sortBy=dateRun&tab=bookmarked%21%5Bimage.png%5D%28attachment%3Aimage.png%29).

### Background
This analysis is a remake of the final project that I submitted for my introductory data science course in the first semester of my master's program. Although I received an A, I decided to redo my analysis implementing the knowledge that I have gained in the semesters that followed. I made several improvements to my original analysis that involved the data preparation process and how the dataset was filtered, as well as selecting the most appropriate statistical measures to use. The original project was a standard R script and a written paper, but I re-did my analysis this time using R kernel with Jupyter Notebook to easily describe my code and show the visualizations along the way.
